			<h3>JAXJOX DumbellConnect digital dumbbell</h3>

			<h3>CYCPLUS T2 smart bike trainer</h3>
			<p>Keep up with your regimen in the off-season using the CYCPLUS T2 smart bike trainer. Designed by and for cycling enthusiasts, it’s great for maintaining your fitness no matter the weather. And it offers an interactive, realistic experience with a super-fast response. Rather than a belt-driven inertial flywheel, it has a BLDC motor and 50 high-performance neodymium magnets for a realistic ride. Not only does this increase the braking force and power output, but it also provides quicker dynamic inertia, simulating gradients faster than before. With a rigorous production calibration process, the T2 can provide incredible precision of power data within 1% accuracy. So plug it in, and the BLDC motor eliminates frictional resistance, simulating different road surfaces and bringing the sensations of riding outdoors, indoors. It doesn’t require an external power source, so you can use it anywhere you like. In fact, it generates energy from your pedal strokes!</p>
			<p>What problem it solves:A smart trainer is a tool you mount your bike on that offers resistance like a normal trainer, but with the added benefit of allowing the resistance to be controlled by cycling apps. If you're looking for an interactive virtual riding experience that connects to popular fitness apps, then smart trainers should be on your radar. Anyone who is training for a race or simply looking to get faster on their bike will also appreciate the metrics and feedback that a smart trainer provides</p>
			<p>How to use it: A smart trainer transmits your power data and can change the resistance so you can feel virtual hills, but you can use a supported classic trainer and a speed sensor instead. You won't get changes in resistance but Zwift will calculate your power based on the speed of your rear wheel. And there is a lot of steps you need to do first, before you can use it, from setting it up, which also need a lot of work to do, to connect it to an app.</p>

			<h3>Speediance all-in-one home gym</h3>
			<p>Get the results you have wanted all along with the Speediance all-in-one home gym. Delivering all the full-body strength training you need—right from the comfort of your own home—it requires only 3.2 ft² of space! With AI power and 4 different power modes, it even offers a 21.5-inch touchscreen that makes it so easy to see your workouts. Furthermore, you can add a variety of smart accessories to target different muscle groups. With a space-saving design, this foldable home gym fits in even small spaces, so it’s great for even those who live in apartments. It offers more than 100 different movements along with automatic weight and noise reduction for easy use anywhere. Eliminating costly, bulky equipment, this is the gadget that can help you efficiently achieve your fitness goals!</p>
			<p>What problem it solves: Starting with one of the first pieces of versatile training equipment, the original Total Gym was designed with the intent of exercising multiple regions of the body without requiring multiple pieces of equipment. Adding to that, it provides a 360-degree overview of our all-in-one home gym GYM MONSTER and elaborates on every part of it, from highlights, features to quality. This smart gym features 220 pounds of weight resistance, a foldable platform for your workouts, and a set of wheels for easy maneuverability.</p>
			<p>How to use it: here are two step you need for this innovation. Step 1: Find the Right Space. Before you can start swinging kettlebells and performing burpees, you need to decide where you want to set up your home gym. At the very least, the space should have enough room for a yoga mat, which is all the space you'll need to stretch and do core exercises. From there, the exact space for your home gym will depend on how much room you have and the workouts you want to accomplish. A HIIT workout might need more space and a solid (but not-too-hard) surface to jump around on, while a yoga or Pilates workout needs a little more space than a yoga mat. A heavy lifting regimen featuring all the bells and whistles will likely require a whole room of its own. Apartment dwellers, if your living situation is bigger than the size of a walk-in closet (*cough* jealous *cough*), dedicate an unused corner of your living room or bedroom to your sweat sessions. An outdoor space like a roomy back porch oratio can work if your local climate and living situation permits it. And if you have a spare bedroom, empty office, or vacant garage that's begging to be used, you've hit the home gym jackpot. Step 2: Stock Your Home Gym
You don't need a ton of equipment or bulky machines to make your home gym an effective place to exercise. In fact, some of the best home workout equipment is actually quite small and inexpensive</p>
			<p>Who is using it(celeb/Starts):While Victoria Beckham spends two hours training each morning in her own fitness studio, Mark Wahlberg heads down to his impressive gym by 3.40am every day so he can complete his own 90-minute workout before most of us are even awake!. Also, Rochelle Humes and her husband Marvin have converted a large room at their new London home into their very own gym, and it could easily be mistaken for a luxury fitness studio. The room has floor-to-ceiling mirrors lining the walls, and equipment including a One Peleton bike and a reformer Pilates machine for all their workout needs.</p>
